## Class 1 — Basics of Python

This folder contains the first-class exercises covering basic Python concepts: printing to the console, reading input, variables and data types, defining and calling functions, and simple arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

**Topics Covered:**
- **Print:** output text with `print()`.
- **Input:** read user input with `input()`.
- **Variables & Data Types:** store values (strings, integers) and convert types with `int()`.
- **Functions:** define reusable blocks using `def` and call them.
- **Simple Operations:** use `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` for arithmetic.

**Files and brief descriptions:**
- `hello.py`: prints "Hello World".
- `helloimproved.py`: defines and calls `print_hello()` to show a simple function.
- `exercise1.py`: asks for three text inputs and prints each response (demonstrates `input()` and `print()`).
- `exercise2.py`: reads two inputs, converts them to integers, and prints their sum (demonstrates type conversion and `+`).
- `exercise3.py`: defines and calls a `print_hello()` function (similar to `helloimproved.py`).
- `exercise4.py`: a small menu demonstrating functions for sum, subtraction, multiplication, and division; it asks the user to choose an operation and performs it on two integer inputs.

**How to run an exercise**
Run any exercise with Python 3 from this directory. Examples:

```bash
python3 exercise1.py
python3 exercise2.py
python3 exercise4.py
```

Tips:
- When an exercise expects numeric input, enter integers (e.g., `3`) so `int()` conversions work.
- For division results, Python 3 returns a float when needed (e.g., `5 / 2` → `2.5`).

If you want, I can also:
- Add short comments inside each file explaining each step.
- Consolidate duplicate examples (there are two simple `print_hello()` variants).
