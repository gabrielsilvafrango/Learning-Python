# Python Classes — Course Materials

This repository contains exercises and examples used during the Python introductory classes. The materials are intended for beginners and focus on core programming fundamentals and simple interactive scripts.

## Course Overview
The class introduces these fundamental programming concepts:

- Print and console output using `print()`.
- Reading user input with `input()` and converting types using `int()`.
- Variables and basic data types (strings, integers, floats).
- Defining and calling functions with `def`.
- Simple arithmetic operations: addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).

## Structure
- `class-1/` — First lesson examples and exercises (see `class-1/README.md` for details).

Each class folder contains small, focused Python scripts that demonstrate one or two concepts and are runnable with Python 3.

## How to run
From the folder of an exercise, run:

```bash
python3 exercise_name.py
```

For example, to run the calculator menu in `class-1`:

```bash
cd class-1
python3 exercise4.py
```

## Recommendations
- Use Python 3.8+ for best compatibility.
- When exercises ask for numeric input, provide integers to avoid conversion errors (or modify the code to handle floats).
- Try editing the scripts to experiment: change prompts, add validation, or extend the menu.

## Next steps
- Add more exercises showing conditional logic, loops, and lists.
- Include small unit tests or example runs for each script.

If you'd like, I can add inline comments to the exercises, create a syllabus-style README per class, or prepare starter/unit tests.
